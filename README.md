# pisecuritysystem
This is a raspberry pi based security camera that uses facial recognition and movement detection to find potential thiefs, and alerts the user when this occurs via text-message and email. The footage is streamed via a website, making it easy to see who is there.

## installation
'sudo apt-get install python3-opencv'
'pip3 install face_recognition'
